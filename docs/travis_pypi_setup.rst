Travis/PyPI Setup
=================

Optionally, your package can automatically be released on PyPI whenever you
push a new tag to the master branch.

How It Works
------------

Your project comes with a script called `travis_pypi_setup.py`.

This script does the following:

* Encrypt your PyPI password in your Travis config.
* Activate automated deployment on PyPI when you push a new tag to master.
